# RUSTETRIS 

I'm learning rust programing language by recreate tetris game using rust and raylib.
The code is messy and unorganized due to poor design of my project.
By the way, Rust is super cool!
And at this state the game is now playable but still missing a lot of feature.

### control
```
A: rotate left
B: rotate right
J: move left
L: move right
K: increase gravity (drop faster)
```

### missing feature
- game restart
- point system
- future pieces
